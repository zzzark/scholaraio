# Design Docs

Status: Current index

Last Updated: 2026-06-12

Design docs are long-lived architecture and runtime decisions. They answer what
must stay true, not just what one implementation plan happened to do.

## Current Authorities

| Document | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `directory-structure-spec.md` | Current runtime directory layout and path ownership |
| `migration-mechanism-spec.md` | Migration control-plane contract, journal, locking, and cleanup gates |
| `directory-migration-sequence.md` | Historical compatibility-window execution order |
| `user-data-migration-strategy.md` | Historical user-data migration strategy and posture |

## Rules

- Put durable architecture decisions here.
- Keep execution checklists in `docs/exec-plans/`.
- Keep validation evidence in `docs/validation/`.
- Link new design docs from this index before treating them as authority.
