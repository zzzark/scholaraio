## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Line-addressable evidence chunk search** ([#35](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/35)): Added `scholaraio index --chunks` and `scholaraio search --chunk` so agents can build a paper-section chunk index from `paper.md` / `meta.json["toc"]` and retrieve source snippets with paper IDs, section titles, line ranges, and normal search filters such as `--year`, `--journal`, and `--type`.
- **Rights-respecting publisher PDF fetch** ([#98](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/98), [#99](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/99)): Added native `scholaraio fetch-pdf` support for DOI, landing-page URL, direct PDF URL, or title locators, plus `--direct` campus-network mode, safe temporary/single-file `--ingest` handoff, and selected/all-library canonical PDF refetch for already ingested papers.
- **Read-only local library WebUI**: Added `scholaraio gui`, a packaged local WebUI for browsing the main paper library and proceedings child papers with live refresh, filters, metadata/quality inspection, Markdown-rendered abstracts/conclusions, local-only math rendering, and inline PDF preview/fullscreen controls.
- **Graphviz DOT/SVG diagram workflow**: Added the Graphviz diagram guide, linked it from the draw skill and writing/CLI docs, and expanded `setup check` to report `Graphviz dot` and `Inkscape` with actionable install guidance for SVG rendering and Beamer insertion.
- **Paper2Any MCP sidecar integration**: Added `scholaraio paper2any` setup, serve, status, and smoke commands, a lightweight MCP sidecar for Paper2Any conversion workflows, configuration and setup diagnostics for the extension checkout and backend API key, and user/agent documentation for running the sidecar from ScholarAIO.

### Changed

- **English CLI and service messages**: Migrated user-facing CLI help, status output, warnings, and service error messages from Chinese to English, and updated the corresponding regression tests so ScholarAIO no longer preserves Chinese compatibility for these message strings.

### Fixed

- **Paper PDF preservation during ingest and repair**: Kept original PDFs beside `paper.md` in the canonical paper directory, using the paper directory stem for the PDF filename, avoided overwriting an existing curated PDF when a duplicate DOI path only needs to restore missing Markdown, and made `attach-pdf` refuse to replace an existing canonical PDF unless `--force` is supplied.
- **Local WebUI robustness and privacy**: Hardened the WebUI against malformed metadata, stale async list/detail responses, full-library re-audits on every poll, non-ASCII PDF filenames, large PDF buffering, stale PDF toolbar state, stale type filters, and remote runtime script loading.
- **Diagram CLI output noise**: Stopped service-layer diagram generation logs from reusing the user-facing `Generated:` prefix, so `diagram --from-text` reports the generated artifact only once.
- **Local MinerU batch image assets**: Saved images returned by the local MinerU API into per-PDF `<pdf_stem>_images/` directories and rewrote Markdown references accordingly, preventing `cmd_batch` runs that share one output directory from overwriting generic image names such as `image_1.png`.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Fresh-layout runtime and one-command upgrade**: Standardized the current runtime layout under `data/libraries/`, `data/spool/`, `data/state/`, and `workspace/_system/`, and added `scholaraio migrate upgrade --migration-id <id> --confirm` as the release-grade path from supported old roots to the fresh layout.
- **Migration finalization safety gates**: Hardened `migrate finalize` with journaled `verify -> cleanup -> verify`, workspace `refs/papers.json` migration, system-output migration into `workspace/_system/`, and archival cleanup for both populated and empty legacy roots.
- **Canonical package architecture**: Completed the package split into `core`, `providers`, `stores`, `projects`, `services`, and `interfaces`, keeping `scholaraio.cli` as the published entrypoint while moving implementation code into canonical namespaces.
- **Webtools MCP support**: Added generic MCP transport support for external webtools, including `GUILessBingSearch` (`search_bing`) and `qt-web-extractor` (`fetch_url`) while keeping HTTP transport available for hosts that need it.
- **Release validation evidence**: Added release validation reports that cross-check current behavior against `origin/main`, `v1.3.1`, actual CLI canaries, migration rehearsal evidence, and docs/skill alignment.
- **Guided single-paper reading workflow**: Added the `paper-guided-reading` skill plus the companion `docs/writing-guide/paper-reading-framework.md` so agents can start from fuzzy intent, confirm one target paper, perform structured deep reading, and persist reusable findings into `notes.md`
- **Incremental metadata scrub workflow**: Added the `scrub` skill for post-enrich metadata cleanup of low-quality paper records, plus reusable `.scrubbed` marker helpers in `papers.py` and conservative scrub-suspect detection helpers in `audit.py`
- **Rsync backup workflow** ([#54](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/54)): Added typed `backup` configuration, the `scholaraio.backup` module, `scholaraio backup list/run`, and the `backup` skill so ScholarAIO data can be synced to named remote targets through rsync instead of hand-written shell commands
- **macOS semantic-search smoke workflow**: Added a dedicated GitHub Actions job on `macos-14` to exercise the `sentence-transformers` -> `faiss-cpu` semantic-search stack and run targeted regression tests for vector-search paths
- **Academic writing router** ([#55](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/55)): Added the `academic-writing` skill as a stable top-level entry point that routes users by deliverable and writing stage instead of forcing them to guess among multiple writing skills
- **Deliverable-first writing workflows** ([#55](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/55)): Added lightweight `poster` and `technical-report` skills so conference posters, poster-style summaries, topic reports, and research briefings are first-class workflows rather than implicit combinations of lower-level skills
- **Writing workflow regression coverage**: Added tests for skill frontmatter validity, router references, approximate host-style skill selection, and 11 rounds of documentation-alignment checks across docs, agent instructions, and marketplace metadata
- **Rendered web URL ingestion** ([#52](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/52)): Added the native `scholaraio ingest-link` CLI, `ingest-link` skill, and `sources.webtools` connector flow so webpages and online PDFs can be ingested through an external `qt-web-extractor` daemon while preserving provenance fields such as `source_url`, `source_type`, `extracted_at`, and `extraction_method`
- **References-only metadata refresh**: `scholaraio refetch` can now backfill structured `references` for DOI-bearing papers, with `--references-only` / `--refs-only` to target only papers whose references are still empty and a Semantic Scholar -> Crossref fallback chain when one source has no usable references

### Fixed

- **Diagram IR rendering robustness**: `diagram --from-ir` now accepts common `source` / `target` edge aliases in addition to the canonical `from` / `to` keys, and reports malformed edges as clean CLI errors instead of tracebacks.
- **Fresh-layout docs and agent entries**: Slimmed agent entry docs into lightweight navigation surfaces, moved deeper runtime guidance into `docs/guide/agent-reference.md`, and aligned README, CLI docs, skills, and setup docs around explicit migration instead of implicit legacy runtime reads.
- **Skill metadata and routing docs**: Normalized active project skill frontmatter to the cross-agent `name` + `description` shape, made descriptions trigger-focused, refreshed the skill harness validator, and fixed router wording that could steal explicit review-response requests.
- **Runtime-layout migration correctness**: Fixed migration verification against real migrated libraries, empty legacy root cleanup, workspace output migration, and recovery/finalization edge cases found during repeated live CLI rehearsals.
- **CLI namespace refactor coverage**: Moved command handlers and shared CLI helpers under `scholaraio.interfaces.cli.*`, keeping command behavior stable while removing implementation dependence on root-level facade modules.
- **Webtools runtime robustness**: Hardened MCP/HTTP webtools configuration, command output, service error handling, and real local service canaries for `websearch`, `webextract`, and `ingest-link`.
- **Topic and search edge cases**: Fixed offline topic CLI validation and search-result citation formatting for legacy scalar `citation_count` values.
- **Writing-skill discovery alignment**: Synchronized `academic-writing`, `docs/guide/writing.md`, `README.md`, `README_CN.md`, `docs/index.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS_CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `clawhub.yaml` so `paper-guided-reading` is discoverable consistently across router, docs, agent instructions, and marketplace metadata
- **Audit title matching and type-aware skips**: `audit` now compares metadata titles against title-like candidates from the first 80 lines of `paper.md`, honors `title_translated`, keeps `missing_doi` / `missing_journal` warnings active when `paper_type` is blank, and skips front-matter-driven `title_mismatch` false positives for dissertation and document-like records
- **Backup runtime robustness**: `scholaraio backup run` now reports missing `rsync` executables as controlled CLI errors, shell-quotes the displayed rsync command preview, defaults full-data backups to the safer `default` rsync mode instead of append-only behavior, forces SSH batch mode so runs fail fast instead of hanging on interactive authentication or host-key prompts, supports a `config.local.yaml` password fallback for password-only hosts, and prints concrete setup guidance when authentication or host trust is not ready yet
- **macOS semantic/unified search crash** ([#65](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/65)): main-library and explore semantic search now embed and normalize the query before loading or searching FAISS indexes, avoiding a known `faiss` / `sentence-transformers` import-order segfault pattern on macOS while preserving existing ranking behavior
- **Academic writing docs alignment** ([#55](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/55)): Synchronized `docs/guide/writing.md`, `README.md`, `README_CN.md`, `docs/index.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS_CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `clawhub.yaml` around a router-first writing model so poster/report workflows and the academic-writing entry point are discoverable consistently across user and agent surfaces
- **`ingest-link` reliability and isolation** ([#52](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/52)): URL ingest now preserves extractor PDF autodetect unless `--pdf` is explicitly requested, isolates both temporary inboxes from the real library, skips only failed URLs in multi-link batches, keeps warning-bearing extractions with usable text, retries transient extraction failures with exponential backoff, and avoids overlong fallback filenames for title-less URLs
- **Scrub workflow edge cases** ([#51](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/51)): `show` now surfaces the stable UUID for partially corrupted records, direct-directory `repair` generates a UUID when recovering markdown-only papers, collision-suffixed directory names no longer get renumbered again by `rename`, and the scrub skill docs now distinguish `invalid_metadata` records from normal `show`-first review paths

### Removed

- **Legacy runtime auto-detection as normal behavior**: Fresh-layout accessors no longer auto-open old runtime roots such as `data/papers/`, `data/explore/`, `data/proceedings/`, or `data/inbox*`; those paths are migration inputs handled by `scholaraio migrate upgrade`.
- **Legacy root-level public facades**: Removed obsolete public facade modules such as `scholaraio.index`, `scholaraio.workspace`, and `scholaraio.translate`; new code imports canonical namespaces directly.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Qwen agent support**: Added `.qwen/skills` symlink to `.claude/skills/` so Qwen-based agents can discover ScholarAIO skills out of the box
- **Qwen project context**: Added `.qwen/QWEN.md` so Qwen Code has a repository-native project context file instead of relying on `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
- **Cursor native project rules**: Added `.cursor/rules/scholaraio.mdc` as the primary Cursor integration path, with `AGENTS.md` as the shared multi-agent instruction source and `.cursorrules` kept only as a legacy fallback
- **OpenAI-compatible embedding backend support**: Added `embed.provider` config with `local` / `openai-compat` / `none` options; cloud API supports configurable `api_base`, `api_key`, `api_timeout`, `batch_size`, and `max_retries`; `provider=none` disables embeddings gracefully and falls back to keyword-only search

### Fixed

- **Cursor compatibility CI coverage**: Added regression coverage to keep the Cursor rule wrapper lightweight and explicitly MCP-free
- **Proceedings routing test stability**: Tests no longer assume the first `data/proceedings` entry is a proceedings volume directory, avoiding CI-only failures when `proceedings.db` sorts before real volume folders
- **Unified search transparency**: `usearch` and `fsearch` now print an explicit message when semantic retrieval is unavailable and the command degrades to keyword-only search
- **Zhipu GLM OpenAI-compatible chat routing** ([#60](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/60)): `call_llm()` now maps `open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas` to the correct `/v4/chat/completions` endpoint instead of incorrectly forcing `/v1/chat/completions`

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

- **AI-for-Science foundation**: ScholarAIO v1.3.0 pushes the project beyond a paper-centric research terminal toward an AI-for-Science runtime. Added five lightweight scientific-computing domains for agents: Quantum ESPRESSO, LAMMPS, GROMACS, OpenFOAM, and bioinformatics
- **Versioned scientific tool docs via `toolref`**: Added `scholaraio toolref fetch/list/show/search/use` plus the top-level `scholaraio.toolref` facade so agents can query exact official interfaces at runtime instead of guessing parameters from memory. Current indexed coverage includes Quantum ESPRESSO, LAMMPS, GROMACS, OpenFOAM, and curated bioinformatics tools
- **Extensible onboarding for new scientific software**: Added a dedicated scientific-tool onboarding workflow so ScholarAIO can keep incorporating user-requested tools through official-doc ingestion, `toolref` integration, lightweight skill design, and end-to-end CLI verification, rather than being limited to the five tools already onboarded
- **Toolref-first scientific runtime design**: Aligned tool-specific scientific skills around a clear separation of concerns: papers and notes hold scientific context, skills hold workflow and judgment, and `toolref` holds exact interface details. This keeps skills lightweight while letting agents stay grounded in both literature and tool docs
- **Semantic Scholar API key support**: Configure `ingest.s2_api_key` (or env var `S2_API_KEY`) to authenticate Semantic Scholar requests, increasing rate limits from 100 req/5min (public) to 1 req/s (authenticated); polite delay automatically reduced from 3s to 1s when key is present
- **PDF parser benchmark harness**: Added `scholaraio/ingest/parser_matrix_benchmark.py` plus tests for comparing Docling / MinerU / PyMuPDF parser runs and configuration matrices
- **Parser-aware setup guidance**: `scholaraio setup` and the setup skill now explain MinerU vs Docling selection, provide official deployment links, note that MinerU tokens for `mineru-open-api` are free to apply for, and warn agent users about sandbox/network mis-detection
- **Insights analytics module coverage**: `scholaraio.insights` now owns reusable behavior-analysis helpers, with dedicated tests plus CLI smoke coverage for `scholaraio insights`

### Fixed

- **PDF parser fallback flow**: Batch conversion and `attach-pdf` now follow the same MinerU → fallback behavior as the main ingest path; fallback assets are preserved; unsupported parser options from the previous broader design were removed so the active chain matches the current MinerU / Docling / PyMuPDF strategy
- **MinerU cloud backend + chunking limits**: All MinerU cloud ingest entrypoints now use the `mineru-open-api` / ModelScope-backed path instead of the old raw API flow, and cloud chunk planning now respects both the 600-page and 200MB single-file limits with size-aware chunk estimation
- **Proceedings ingest routing**: Regular `data/inbox/` items no longer auto-route into `data/proceedings/`; proceedings now enter that workflow only through the dedicated `data/inbox-proceedings/` inbox, and misclassified real-library proceedings shells were cleaned back into normal paper ingest
- **Setup robustness for agents**: `setup` / `setup check` no longer fail hard when `metrics.db` is locked, parser recommendations honor an already-configured MinerU token before network probing, and interactive prompts treat EOF as empty input so agent-driven stdin does not crash the wizard
- **Docs consistency**: README, README_CN, AGENTS, and CLAUDE now describe the current parser stack and setup behavior consistently
- **arXiv ingest edge cases**: `scholaraio.sources.arxiv` no longer makes `bs4` a transitive hard dependency for normal metadata flows, and old-style arXiv IDs like `hep-th/9901001` now create parent directories correctly during PDF download
- **Scientific runtime docs compatibility**: toolref runtime behavior, scientific skills, and published setup/docs metadata now match the refactored `toolref` facade and current public CLI/package surface
- **Optional dependency guidance**: missing-dependency messages and `setup check` now consistently point users to `scholaraio[import]`, `scholaraio[pdf]`, `scholaraio[office]`, and `scholaraio[draw]` instead of raw leaf packages
- **Translate / enrich CLI feedback and recovery**: `translate` now reports chunk-level progress, persists per-chunk state in `.translate_{lang}/`, resumes unfinished work safely, and avoids writing fake success output when every chunk fails; `enrich-toc` now reports start/success/failure with extracted TOC counts for single-paper runs
- **Workspace removal and refetch status accuracy**: `ws remove` now falls back to exact workspace `dir_name` matching when registry lookup misses, and `refetch` no longer reports spurious updates when API enrichment returns no authoritative data

### Removed

- **MCP server**: Removed `scholaraio/mcp_server.py` (1585 lines, 32 tools) and the `scholaraio-mcp` entry point. All agent interactions now go through CLI + skills, which are agent-agnostic and supported across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and GitHub Copilot. The `[mcp]` optional dependency group has also been removed.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Agent analysis notes (T2)**: Per-paper `notes.md` for persistent cross-session analysis notes; `show` now auto-displays existing notes, `show --append-notes` appends new notes, and `loader.load_notes()` / `loader.append_notes()` expose the workflow in Python
- **Context management guidance**: Workspace skill and 4 academic writing skills updated with `notes.md` read/write workflow and large-content delegation guidance for subagent-heavy analysis

### Fixed

- **Zotero LaTeX filename too long** ([#32](https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio/issues/32)): Titles containing LaTeX math (e.g. `$\mathrm{La}{\mathrm{BH}}_8$`) or HTML/MathML entities now get properly cleaned before directory naming; added 255-byte filename length limit as safety net

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Patent literature management**: New `data/inbox-patent/` inbox for patent documents; automatic publication number extraction (CN/US/EP/WO/JP/KR/DE/FR/GB/TW/IN/AU + more formats); deduplication by publication number; `paper_type: patent` auto-tagging; `publication_number` field in `PaperMetadata` and `papers_registry`
- **Paper translation** (`translate` CLI + skill): LLM-based markdown translation preserving LaTeX formulas, code blocks, and images; language detection heuristic; configurable defaults (`config.yaml` `translate` section) with per-call `--lang`/`--force` override; single paper and batch modes; `show --lang` to view translated versions; `pipeline --steps translate` for batch processing
- **Federated search** (`fsearch` CLI + `federated_search` MCP tool): search across main library, explore silos (`explore:NAME` / `explore:*`), and arXiv in a single command; arXiv results annotated with "已入库" when DOI matches the main library
- **arXiv source module** (`sources/arxiv.py`): shared Atom API client using `defusedxml` for safe XML parsing
- **Insights analytics** (`scholaraio insights`): behavior dashboard showing top search keywords, most-read papers, weekly reading trend, semantic neighbor recommendations, and active workspaces with paper counts
- **Metrics recording for search/read**: `search`, `usearch`, `vsearch`, and `show` commands now record events to `metrics.db` for behavior analysis
- **`MetricsStore.query_distinct_names()`**: efficient distinct-name query with supporting `(category, name)` index, used by insights recommendations
- **Skill YAML front matter**: all 26 skills now carry standardized `version`/`author`/`license`/`tags` metadata; new `insights` and `document` skills added
- **clawhub.yaml**: marketplace manifest listing all available skills for discovery
- **`explore fetch --limit`**: cap the number of papers fetched from OpenAlex (useful for quick sampling)
- **`attach-pdf --dry-run`**: preview what `attach-pdf` will do without actually running MinerU conversion
- **`document inspect`** (`scholaraio document inspect <file>`): inspect Office documents (DOCX/PPTX/XLSX) showing structure, layout, content preview, and overflow warnings; new `document.py` module with `inspect_pptx`/`inspect_docx`/`inspect_xlsx` functions
- **Office format ingest**: `inbox-doc/` now accepts `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx` files; new `step_office_convert` pipeline step converts them to Markdown via MarkItDown before ingestion
- **RIS export**: `export ris` outputs RIS format compatible with Zotero, Endnote, and Mendeley (zero dependencies)
- **Markdown reference list export**: `export markdown` generates formatted reference lists with configurable citation styles (APA, Vancouver, Chicago, MLA); supports ordered/unordered lists
- **DOCX export**: `export docx` converts any Markdown content to a Word `.docx` file, supporting headings, paragraphs, tables, lists, code blocks, and bold/italic text
- **Citation styles module** (`citation_styles.py`): manages built-in (APA/Vancouver/Chicago/MLA) and custom citation formats; custom styles loaded from `data/citation_styles/*.py` with path-traversal protection
- **draw skill** (`.claude/skills/draw/`): generate diagrams (Mermaid flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams, Gantt charts, mind maps) and vector graphics (cli-anything-inkscape); outputs to `workspace/figures/`
- **`[office]` optional dependency group**: `markitdown[docx,pptx,xlsx]` + `python-docx`

### Fixed

- **Chicago citation format**: empty authors list no longer causes `IndexError`; condition reordered to check `not authors` first (consistent with APA/Vancouver)
- **Federated search DOI annotation**: `WHERE doi IN (...)` replaced with `WHERE LOWER(doi) IN (...)` in `cli.py`, preventing false negatives when stored DOIs have different casing
- **`insights --days` validation**: replaced `args.days or 30` with explicit `days <= 0` check; `--days 0` or negative values now produce a clear error instead of silently defaulting to 30

- CLI error messages and output text unified to Chinese
- `citation_styles`: `show_style()`, `list_styles()`, `get_formatter()` error messages Chinese-ified; Google-style docstrings added
- **Translation same-language skip**: language detection now recognizes common German/French/Spanish inputs, avoiding unnecessary same-language translation calls for supported targets

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Workspace batch add**: `ws add` now supports `--search "<query>"`, `--topic <id>`, and `--all` flags for bulk paper addition, with `--limit`/`--year`/`--journal`/`--type` filter support (`--top` remains a compatibility alias)
- **PDF optional dependency**: `pymupdf` declared in `pyproject.toml` as `[pdf]` extra (included in `[full]`), fixing undeclared dependency for long PDF splitting
- **Subagent information tiers**: T1/T2/T3 architecture documented in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for structured context management

### Fixed

- **MCP `build_topics`**: `nr_topics=0` now correctly maps to `"auto"` (automatic topic merging/reduction) instead of `None` (no reduction); added `-1` as explicit "no reduction" value

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-13
