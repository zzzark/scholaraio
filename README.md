---

Your coding agent already reads code, writes code, and runs experiments. ScholarAIO adds a structured research workspace on top, so the same agent can search literature, cross-check results against papers, use scientific software more accurately, and carry the whole research workflow from one terminal.

- Your paper library becomes a reusable knowledge base for the same agent.
- When scientific software questions come up, the agent can consult official documentation at runtime instead of guessing from prompts.
- The system is built to keep expanding as new tools and workflows become worth supporting.

</div>

ScholarAIO offers more than search. It gives an AI coding agent a research workspace that supports natural-language interaction, papers and notes, more reliable use of scientific software, writing and running code, checking results against the literature, and structured academic writing.

## Quick Start

The default and recommended way to use ScholarAIO is simple: install it, configure it once, and open this repository directly with your coding agent.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZimoLiao/scholaraio.git
cd scholaraio
pip install -e ".[full]"
scholaraio setup
```

Then open the repository in Codex, Claude Code, or another supported agent. In this setup, the agent gets the fullest experience: bundled instructions, local skills, the CLI, and the complete codebase context are all available directly. For Claude Code plugins, Codex/OpenClaw skill registration, and other setup paths, see [`docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md`](docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md).

## Upgrading To 1.4

ScholarAIO 1.4 is a runtime-layout upgrade. It does **not** migrate user data
automatically during `git pull`, `pip install -U`, or normal CLI startup. That is
intentional: data movement is an explicit offline operation with a migration
journal and verification.

Recommended path:

```bash
# 1. Update the code/package
git pull
pip install -e ".[full]"

# 2. From the ScholarAIO runtime root, inspect and migrate explicitly
scholaraio migrate status
scholaraio migrate upgrade --migration-id upgrade-1.4.0 --confirm
scholaraio migrate verify --migration-id upgrade-1.4.0

# 3. Rebuild indexes after migrated data lands in the fresh layout
scholaraio index --rebuild
```

For the lowest-risk upgrade, keep or copy your old ScholarAIO folder first, then
run the migration in the upgraded checkout that contains your `data/`,
`workspace/`, and `config*.yaml`. See
[`docs/getting-started/upgrading-to-1.4.md`](docs/getting-started/upgrading-to-1.4.md).

## What It Does

|  | Feature | Details |
|--|---------|---------|
| **PDF Parsing** | Deep structure extraction | Convert PDFs into structured Markdown while preserving formulas, figures, and layout as much as possible |
| **Not Just Papers** | More than papers | Journal articles, theses, patents, technical reports, standards, and lecture notes — four inbox categories with tailored metadata handling |
| **Hybrid Search** | Keyword + semantic fusion | Combine full-text and vector retrieval, with optional line-addressable evidence chunk search for precise source snippets |
| **Topic Discovery** | See what your library is about | Automatically group papers into research themes and use interactive views to grasp the overall structure quickly |
| **Literature Exploration** | Multi-dimensional discovery | Explore a research direction through journal, topic, author, institution, keyword, year, citation impact, and more |
| **Citation Graph** | References & impact | Forward citations, backward citations, and shared-reference analysis |
| **Layered Reading** | Read on demand | Start with metadata or the abstract, then move into conclusions or full text only when you need to |
| **Local Library WebUI** | Browse and inspect | Open a read-only local UI for records, audit status, Markdown abstracts/conclusions, proceedings children, and PDFs without exposing library data to remote scripts |
| **Publisher PDF Fetch** | Use your current access | Fetch DOI or publisher-page PDFs through the user's legal network context, with direct campus-network mode and selected/all-library PDF refetch |
| **Multi-Source Import** | Connect your existing library | Import directly from reference managers, fetched PDFs, local PDFs, and Markdown without rebuilding your library from scratch |
| **Workspaces** | Organize by project | Manage paper subsets with scoped search and BibTeX export |
| **Multi-Format Export** | BibTeX, RIS, Markdown, DOCX | Export your full library or a workspace for Zotero, Endnote, submission, or sharing |
| **Metadata Scrub** | Incremental cleanup after enrich | Review and repair low-quality titles, authors, and years for non-standard documents, then mark reviewed records to skip future passes |
| **Persistent Notes** | Cross-session memory | Keep analysis notes for each paper so future sessions can reuse them instead of starting over |
| **Research Insights** | Reading behavior analytics | Search hot keywords, most-read papers, reading trends, and semantic neighbor recommendations for papers you haven't read yet |
| **Federated Discovery** | Cross-library search | Search your main library, exploration libraries, and arXiv from one entry point instead of hopping across tools |
| **Remote Backup** | Rsync-based sync | Back up the ScholarAIO `data/` workspace to configured remote targets through named rsync plans |
| **AI-for-Science Runtime** | Use scientific software more accurately | Use scientific software against official documentation at runtime instead of guessing commands and parameters |
| **Extensible Tool Onboarding** | Keep adding the tools that matter | As new scientific tools and workflows become important, the system can keep expanding |
| **Academic Writing** | AI-assisted writing | Router-first workflows for literature review, guided single-paper reading, paper sections, citation check, rebuttal, gap analysis, poster packages, and technical reports — with every citation traceable to your own library |

For writing tasks, start with the router-style writing entry when the deliverable is clear but the workflow is not. The current writing stack is organized around:

- `academic-writing`: route by deliverable and writing stage
- `nature-workflow`: bridge to the upstream `nature-skills` bundle for Nature/high-impact figures, polishing, writing, reviewer critique, citation, Data Availability, paper reading, reviewer response, paper-to-PPT, and academic search; direct upstream skills are preferred when available
- `literature-review`: long-form review and survey writing
- `paper-guided-reading`: guided deep reading of a single paper from fuzzy search to full-text analysis
- `paper-writing`: manuscript sections and paper-focused drafting
- `review-response`: rebuttal and response-letter workflows
- `research-gap`: gap analysis and open-question reports
- `technical-report`: technical briefings and topic reports
- `poster`: poster-oriented content packaging
- `document`: final DOCX / PPTX packaging

See [`docs/guide/writing.md`](docs/guide/writing.md) for the full writing map.

## Works With Your Agent

ScholarAIO is designed to be **agent-agnostic**, but different agents expose different integration paths. Some work best when you open this repository directly; others are easier to use through plugins.

| Agent / IDE | Open this repo directly | Reuse from another project |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills/` | Claude plugin marketplace |
| [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) / OpenClaw | `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/skills/` | `scholaraio setup agent` |
| [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) | `.clinerules` + `.claude/skills/` | `scholaraio setup agent --target-project ...` |
| [Qwen](https://qwen.ai/) | `.qwen/QWEN.md` + `.qwen/skills/` | `scholaraio setup agent --target-project ...` |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) | `.cursor/rules/scholaraio.mdc` + `AGENTS.md` (`.cursorrules` legacy fallback) | `scholaraio setup agent --target-project ...` |
| [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) | `.windsurfrules` | `scholaraio setup agent --target-project ...` |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `scholaraio setup agent --target-project ...` |

Skills follow the open [AgentSkills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard, and `.agents/skills/` and `.qwen/skills/` are symlinks to `.claude/skills/` so different agents can discover and reuse the same skills. Qwen-specific project context lives in `.qwen/QWEN.md`.

For reuse from another project, run `scholaraio setup agent` to preview shell, skill-discovery, and project-wrapper changes; add `--apply` to perform the automatic steps.

Wrappers created with `--target-project` include local machine paths; review the managed block before committing those files to a shared repository.

**Migrating from existing tools?** Import directly from Endnote (XML/RIS) and Zotero (Web API or local SQLite), with PDFs, metadata, and references brought over together. If your current network has publisher access, `scholaraio fetch-pdf` can also pull DOI or landing-page PDFs into the normal ingest flow or refresh canonical PDFs for existing library records.

## Configuration

> Start by opening `scholaraio` with your agent and let it walk you through the setup. The notes below are only a basic overview.

ScholarAIO works with a minimal setup and can be expanded as needed.

- `scholaraio setup` walks you through the basics.
- `scholaraio setup agent` configures cross-project agent discovery and CLI runtime wiring.
- An LLM API key is optional but recommended for more robust metadata extraction and content completion.
- A MinerU token is optional but recommended, and free. You can also deploy MinerU or Docling locally for PDF parsing.
- `scholaraio setup check` shows what is installed, what is optional, and what is missing.

Full setup and configuration details → [`docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md`](docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md), [`config.yaml`](config.yaml)

## Agent First, CLI Available

ScholarAIO works best through an AI coding agent, but it also provides a CLI for scripting, debugging, and quick queries. For a current command reference aligned with the code, see [`docs/guide/cli-reference.md`](docs/guide/cli-reference.md).
